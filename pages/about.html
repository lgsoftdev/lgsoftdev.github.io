                Hi there! I'm Lynn. I originally came from a Business (Accounting) background. Like many who enter the Accounting profession, I intended to become a fully pledged CPA. But it was not meant to be. I needed to find a career which I can genuinely be excited about. I did further studies in a very unfamiliar area of Information Technology. I was fortunate to have been offered a place in a Microsoft training program and after completion, I was assigned to a client project as a Visual Basic Developer. It was really only when I started working on my first client project that I truly felt that I made the right choice for a career change. I was fully engrossed in programming and I had fun doing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been on an extended career break for almost five years to care for my family. I am now looking to restart my career. I would love to return to Software Development because for me, programming is creative, analytical and fun. I am currently undertaking a 12 week Java Software Engineering program with <strong>_nology</strong>. I feel that the training program, support and guidance from <strong>_nology</strong> would be a great way for me to refresh old skills, gain new knowledge and gain confidence in transitioning back into the workforce.
            </p>
