# Welcome to my Portfolio!

This Porfolio website was built using HTML, CSS, SCSS, and a bit of JavaScript. As I progress through the \_nology course, I may gradually improve on the design and functionalities of this website.

I chose to keep the website design very simple. I used a lot of white so the site looks clean and uncluttered.

This website tells you a little bit about myself. It will list all the projects I will be developing using various software engineering technologies. The projects will link to a live version and a link to the matching GitHub repository.
