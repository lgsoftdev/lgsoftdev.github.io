# Welcome to my Portfolio!

This Porfolio website was built using HTML, CSS, SCSS, and a bit of JavaScript. As I progress through the \_nology course, I may gradually improve on the design and functionalities of this website.

I chose to keep the website design very simple. I used a lot of white so the site looks clean and uncluttered.
