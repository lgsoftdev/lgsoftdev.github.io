# Welcome to my <a href="https://lgsoftdev.github.io/" target="blank">Porfolio</a>!

The Porfolio website aims to showcase my software development skills and to give site visitors an insight to who I am. It currently lists all future projects I will be developing using various software engineering technologies. The projects will link to a live version and a link to the matching GitHub repository. The website also provides my contact details.

The following MVP requirements were addressed during the development of the Portfolio website:

  - A Project page/sections
  - A Contact page/section

## Summary

<br>
I first created a sitemap for the Portfolio website to plan how each required pages or sections link together. I made a conscious decision to create multiple web pages at this time so I may redevelop the site into a single page application when I acquire knowledge and skills in ReactJS. I chose to keep the website design very simple. I used a lot of white so the site looks clean and uncluttered.
<br><br>
The website was built using HTML, CSS, SCSS, and a bit of JavaScript. Every effort to use the BEM naming convention for SCSS selectors was made. Variables, mixins, media queries and a function were used to define styles. The website was viewed in various screen sizes to test it's responsiveness and ensure page content is displayed correctly.
<br><br>
As I progress through the \_nology course, I will gradually improve on the design and functionalities of my Portfolio website.
